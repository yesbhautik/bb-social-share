## üé® Customization

- **Editing API Keys**: To edit the API key used for URL shortening, open the plugin file (`bb-social-share.php`) and locate the `$apiKey` variable. Replace the existing API key with your own Bit.ly API key.
- **Adding/Removing Social Media Platforms**: To add or remove social media platforms, open the plugin file (`bb-social-share.php`) and locate the `bb_social_share_buttons()` function. Within the function, you'll find the HTML code for the social sharing buttons. To add a new platform, copy the existing button code and modify it with the appropriate URL and platform name. To remove a platform, simply delete the corresponding button code.
